    <h1>Steady Leadership for a Serious Nation</h1>

    <p class="fireside-quote">
      “The only thing we have to fear is… fear itself.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Democratic government must be equal to its moment. It must be serious,
      disciplined, and worthy of the public trust. When institutions weaken,
      confidence falters. When leadership steadies, the nation advances.
    </p>

    <p>
      From 2002 to 2004, I served as House Minority Leader in Evergreen.
      In that role, we proved that responsible leadership does not require
      a majority — it requires conviction, strategy, and respect for the
      institution itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, I seek election to the United States Senate to bring that same
      steadiness, legislative discipline, and reform-minded leadership to a
      larger national stage.

  <!-- NATIONAL PURPOSE -->
  <section class="national-purpose">
    <h2>Our Common Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of
      those who have much, but whether we provide enough for those who have too
      little. Government exists to secure opportunity, stability, and dignity
      for all who contribute to the life of the nation.

  <div class="platform-item">
    <h2>Proven Legislative Results</h2>
    <p>
      During my tenure as House Minority Leader, three major legislative
      initiatives I introduced were enacted into law — addressing education
      accountability, economic stabilization, and public safety.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Child Left Behind Act of 2003</strong> — strengthened academic standards, accountability, and parental involvement.</li>
      <li><strong>New Deal for American Stability Act of 2003</strong> — promoted job growth, housing supply expansion, infrastructure modernization, and fiscal discipline.</li>
      <li><strong>Firearms Responsibility, Rights, and Public Safety Act of 2003</strong> — protected constitutional rights while prioritizing enforcement against violent offenders.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These were not symbolic proposals. They were enacted reforms —
      advanced while serving in the minority.
