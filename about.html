    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>A Record of Public Service</h2>
      <p>
        I joined the USGR political community on November 6, 2025, driven by a
        belief that public institutions should serve the people with integrity,
        seriousness, and respect for the rule of law. From the beginning, my focus
        has been on strengthening institutions and restoring public trust.

    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>Attorney General of Frontier</h2>
      <p>
        As Attorney General, I served as the state’s chief legal officer, responsible
        for upholding the law, defending the interests of Frontier, and ensuring that
        justice was administered fairly and consistently. The role demanded careful
        judgment, independence, and a commitment to applying the law without fear
        or favor.
      </p>

    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>Lieutenant Governor</h2>
      <p>
        In my service as Lieutenant Governor of Frontier, I worked closely with
        executive leadership and legislators to help guide policy, manage government
        operations, and represent the state in moments requiring steady leadership.
        The office reinforced the importance of cooperation, accountability, and
        responsible governance.

    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>Chief Justice, Court of Appeals</h2>
      <p>
        I later served as Chief Justice over the federal Courts of Appeals, where the
        responsibility was not political, but constitutional. In that role, I focused
        on the fair interpretation of the law, judicial restraint, and maintaining
        public confidence in an independent judiciary.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>Why I Am Running</h2>
      <p>
        My decision to run for the United States Senate is grounded in experience
        across all three branches of government. I believe effective leadership
        requires an understanding of how laws are written, enforced, and interpreted.
        This campaign is about applying that experience to serve the people of
        Evergreen with seriousness, principle, and resolve.
