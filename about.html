      “Public office is a public trust.”

    <p>
      This campaign is rooted in a lifelong commitment to public service and the
      belief that democratic government must be competent, principled, and worthy
      of the confidence placed in it by the American people.

      <h2>A Record of Public Service</h2>
      <p>
        My career in public life has been shaped by service across every branch of
        government, guided by a simple belief: public authority exists to serve the
        American people, not itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each office I have held carried distinct responsibilities, but all shared
        a common purpose — stewardship of the public trust and a responsibility to
        put America first through effective, principled governance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="platform-item">
  <h2>House Minority Leader (2002–2004)</h2>
  <p>
    Serving as House Minority Leader required legislative discipline,
    coalition-building, and strategic restraint. Despite operating
    without majority control, three major legislative proposals were
    enacted into law during my tenure.
  </p>
  <p>
    That experience affirmed that effective leadership is not measured
    by volume, but by results.
  </p>
</div>


    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>State Attorney General</h2>
      <p>
        As State Attorney General, I served as the chief legal officer of the state,
        charged with enforcing the law, defending the public interest, and ensuring
        that justice was administered fairly and without favor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The office demanded independence and sound judgment, particularly when
        political pressure conflicted with the rule of law. Upholding the law —
        even when difficult — was not optional; it was the duty of the office.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>Lieutenant Governor</h2>
      <p>
        In my service as Lieutenant Governor, I worked closely with executive
        leadership and legislators to guide policy, oversee government operations,
        and represent the state during moments requiring steady and responsible
        leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        That experience reinforced the importance of cooperation, accountability,
        and administrative competence in democratic government.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>Federal Judge</h2>
      <p>
        My service on the federal bench required a deliberate separation from
        politics and a disciplined commitment to the fair and impartial
        interpretation of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each case was approached with respect for constitutional limits, judicial
        independence, and the obligation to decide matters based on law rather
        than passion or pressure.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals</h2>
      <p>
        Serving as Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals carried responsibility not
        only for individual decisions, but for the leadership and integrity of the
        judiciary itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that role, I worked to ensure that the courts functioned efficiently,
        consistently, and with the confidence of the public they serve.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>Why I Am Running</h2>
      <p>
        I am running because moments of national uncertainty demand experience,
        judgment, and steady leadership. Having served in executive, legal, and
        judicial capacities, I understand how government functions — and where it
        can fail the people it exists to serve.
      </p>
      <p>
        This campaign is not about ideology or ambition. It is about responsibility:
        governing with seriousness, competence, and a clear commitment to putting
        America first through strong, trusted institutions.
