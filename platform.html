      <h2>Putting Working Families First</h2>
      <p>
Our nation was founded with the blood, sweat, and tears of American patriots seeking to dictate the terms of their own destiny. 
This commitment to sovereignty constituted a unique society that cannot be boiled down to a mere set of policies. America has a unique culture, identity, and faith which we are committed to preserving at all costs. 
I am committed to supporting institutions and politicians aligned with constituting a sovereign conservative movement. 
Above all, we must remember that this nation is ours, we built it, and that it belongs to our people and to God.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encourage job creation through domestic investment</li>
        <li>Support small businesses and local employers</li>
        <li>Promote fair competition and responsible trade policies</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Stability</h2>
      <p>
America is under attack. Our traditions, customs, and beliefs are actively being erased by a hostile foreign elite. 
Our immigration system has been weaponized to replace our population with more compliant workers and voters. Our fiscal and monetary policies have produced a system of debt slavery and financialization, 
enriching creditors and multinational corporations at the expense of the American Dream. 
Most disastrously of all, foreign and immoral ideologies like zionism, nihilism, and liberal multiculturalism have embedded themselves within our society and have undermined our nation's sovereignty.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce wasteful government spending</li>
        <li>Protect Social Security for current and future retirees</li>
        <li>Maintain a balanced approach to taxation and growth</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>Accountability and Integrity in Government</h2>
      <p>
Today, we face incredible issues with accountability and integrity in government. Immigration, foreign wars, corruption, that offend our dignity as citizens of what is supposed to be the greatest country in the world. 
We had a land united by a common faith, ethnicity, and culture, ruled by our kinsmen, but it wasn’t enough because we did not have sovereignty. 
<br><br>The same question remains: who is really in charge? Our elected representatives or a class of oligarchs, foreign interests, and influence?
We need able bodied young men, warriors, geniuses, and citizens to dedicate themselves to American sovereignty and independence. This is a multi generational struggle to liberate our civilization. 
It's America first, no walls, no little hats, just the flag, the cross, and who we are. I hope we can reflect that in the ballot box in the coming weeks.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strengthen ethical rules for public officials</li>
        <li>Increase transparency in government decision-making</li>
        <li>Reduce unnecessary bureaucracy and red tape</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>Law, Order, and Community Safety</h2>
      <p>
        Safe communities are essential to opportunity and quality of life.
        Effective law enforcement and fair justice policies must work together
        to protect citizens and uphold the rule of law.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support community-based policing efforts</li>
        <li>Ensure laws are enforced fairly and consistently</li>
        <li>Provide resources to keep neighborhoods safe</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>National Strength and Responsible Leadership</h2>
      <p>
My platform and goals are to seek and promote a unified national and religious identity grounded in Christianity, to advance policies that serve the present and future prosperity of the United States,
 and to inspire young leaders to join in this fight. 
Through our events, publications, and fellowships, we are building a formidable network of activists and thought leaders committed to preserving our nation and reclaiming our independence.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support a strong and prepared military</li>
        <li>Promote diplomacy backed by credibility and strength</li>
        <li>Protect America’s long-term security interests</li>
      </ul>
