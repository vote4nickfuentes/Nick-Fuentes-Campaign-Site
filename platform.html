  <h1>A Senate Agenda Rooted in Experience</h1>

  <p class="fireside-quote">
    “Public office is a public trust.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Philosophy must translate into policy. Between 2002 and 2004, I worked
    to demonstrate that reform can be achieved without extremism and that
    constitutional governance can coexist with decisive action.
  </p>

  <p>
    My Senate platform builds directly upon the legislation already enacted
    during my tenure as House Minority Leader — expanding proven reforms
    to strengthen national stability, accountability, and institutional trust.

    <h2>America First Means Economic Security</h2>
    <p>
      Economic security is not theory — it is policy enacted into law. As House
      Minority Leader, I introduced and passed the <strong>New Deal for American Stability Act of 2003</strong>,
      a targeted reform focused on job creation, payroll tax relief, domestic
      investment incentives, housing supply expansion, and infrastructure modernization.
    </p>
    <p>
      That legislation proved that economic intervention can be temporary,
      disciplined, and fiscally responsible — without creating permanent entitlement expansion.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Payroll tax relief for job creation</li>
      <li>State-led infrastructure block grants with private capital participation</li>
      <li>Housing supply incentives tied to regulatory reform</li>
      <li>Strict five-year sunset and $55B spending cap for fiscal discipline</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="platform-item">
    <h2>National Recovery Through American Industry</h2>
    <p>
      The New Deal for American Stability Act strengthened domestic production
      and removed regulatory bottlenecks that slowed growth. It prioritized
      transportation, energy, logistics, and advanced manufacturing — ensuring
      that recovery meant structural resilience, not short-term stimulus.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Senate, I will expand domestic investment incentives while preserving
      state control, regulatory modernization, and economic competitiveness.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Infrastructure investment using American labor and materials</li>
      <li>Streamlined federal permitting to reduce economic delay</li>
      <li>Investment tax credits for domestic expansion and modernization</li>
      <li>Regulatory review safeguards to ensure efficiency without repeal by default</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="platform-item">
    <h2>Responsible Government, Not Weak Government</h2>
    <p>
      Responsible government means acting decisively while preserving constitutional
      limits. The New Deal for American Stability Act included strict fiscal safeguards —
      no permanent entitlements, no deficit funding, and mandatory sunset provisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reform without restraint is instability. Inaction without responsibility is failure.
      My legislative record demonstrates that government can act — and then step back.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spending caps and automatic sunset provisions</li>
      <li>No creation of permanent mandatory spending programs</li>
      <li>Funding sourced through surplus and growth, not structural deficit expansion</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="platform-item">
    <h2>Integrity, Law, and Democratic Trust</h2>
    <p>
      Public trust is strengthened when laws are clear, fair, and constitutionally grounded.
      The <strong>Firearms Responsibility, Rights, and Public Safety Act of 2003</strong> protected
      Second Amendment rights while prioritizing enforcement against violent offenders.
    </p>
    <p>
      That legislation clarified federal firearms law, protected due process in mental health
      adjudications, and preserved state authority — proving that liberty and order are not opposites.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interstate concealed carry recognition with state authority preserved</li>
      <li>Affirmative reliance defense for citizens following DOJ guidance</li>
      <li>Focused federal-state task force grants targeting violent offenders</li>
      <li>Due process protections and judicial review safeguards</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="platform-item">
    <h2>Public Safety and National Stability</h2>
    <p>
      Public safety policy must target criminal misuse, not lawful ownership.
      The Firearms Responsibility Act prioritized prosecution of violent offenders
      and firearms trafficking — without expanding federal surveillance or creating
      new blanket prohibitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stability comes from enforcement consistency and constitutional clarity —
      not regulatory confusion.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Priority prosecution of felons unlawfully possessing firearms</li>
      <li>Task force support for enforcement of existing law</li>
      <li>Voluntary firearm safety incentives without mandates</li>
      <li>Explicit prohibition on creation of a federal registry</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="platform-item">
    <h2>Education Accountability and Opportunity</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>No Child Left Behind Act of 2003</strong>, enacted during my tenure
      as House Minority Leader, established measurable statewide standards,
      annual assessments, and transparent reporting to parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Education reform requires accountability paired with local flexibility.
      The law strengthened standards while preserving state-level implementation authority.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear statewide academic standards in reading, mathematics, and science</li>
      <li>Annual assessment transparency with publicly reported results</li>
      <li>Adequate Yearly Progress benchmarks and corrective action plans</li>
      <li>Teacher qualification standards and parental reporting requirements</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="platform-item">
    <h2>America First in the World</h2>
    <p>
      America’s foreign policy must serve the security and prosperity of our people.
      A strong national defense is essential, but engagement abroad must remain grounded
      in national interest and constitutional authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Domestic strength — economic, institutional, and civic — is the foundation of
      credible global leadership.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A strong, prepared national defense</li>
      <li>Diplomacy grounded in national interest and credibility</li>
      <li>Avoidance of unnecessary foreign entanglements</li>
    </ul>
